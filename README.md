# Professor-and-Parties
A professor went to a party. Being an erudite person, he classified the party into two categories. He proposed that if all the persons in the party are wearing different colored robes, then that is a girl’s only party. If we even get one duplicate color, it must be a boy’s party. The colors of the robes are represented by positive integers.
